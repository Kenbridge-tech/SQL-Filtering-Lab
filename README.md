# SQL-Filtering-Lab

### Description

This project was part of my **Google Cybersecurity Course,** where I practiced using SQL as a tool for security investigations.

In this lab, I worked with an organization’s employee and login database, writing queries that could uncover suspicious activity and support system updates.

It was a great opportunity to strengthen my analytical skills and see how simple SQL filters can make a big difference in finding the right data during an investigation.

### Tools & Environment Used:

I worked in a realistic setup, using:

- **Database:** MariaDB (to simulate an organization’s employee/login system)

- **Language:** SQL (for writing and testing queries)

- **Platform:** Linux terminal with MariaDB shell

### **Project Objectives**

The main idea was to explore how SQL queries help security teams find the “signal” in the “noise.” My tasks included:

- Identifying failed login attempts that could point to brute-force or misuse.

- Reviewing suspicious logins on specific dates to track unusual activity.

- Filtering login attempts from outside a trusted region.

- Retrieving employee details by department for quick account updates.

- Excluding irrelevant data so that reports remain clean and easy to read.
